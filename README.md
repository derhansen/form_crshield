Challenge/response spam shield for TYPO3 ext:form
=================================================

## What is it?

Form challenge/response spambot shield is a TYPO3 extension to prevent automated form submissions
in TYPO3 form extension.

## How does it work?

Form challenge/response spam shield adds a hidden input field to every form generated by the TYPO3 form
extension. The input field has a precalculated value with a challenge. The included JavaScript will
use the challenge to calculate an expected response which will be checked on every form submission.
If the expected response is not submitted, validation for the hidden input field is considered as
failed and no email will be sent.

In order to make automatic form submissions harder for spambots with active JavaScript, a configurable
delay for the JavaScript response calculation can be defined in the extension settings (default value: 3 seconds).

## Can the protection be bypassed?

Yes, the challenge/response spam shield can be bypassed, if the algorithm used by the extension is implemented
to a spambot. This is however unlikely, since the spambot either has to use JavaScript (which I believe most
spambots do not) or has to extract the challenge from the parsed HTML and must calculate and submit the response
correctly.

## Requirements

The extension uses JavaScript to calculate the expected response, so if JavaScript is disabled on client
side, form submission will not be possible.

A modern webbrowser is required to run the JavaScript. Internet Explorer < 11 is not supported.

## Installation

Just install the extension on your TYPO3 website using composer or the TYPO3 extension manager.
No further configuration is required.

## Extension settings

The extension has the following extension settings, which can be adjusted if required. The default
values should however be fine for most websites.

### crJavaScriptDelay

Defines the delay in seconds for the JavaScript response calculation. The default value is `3` seconds.

### minimumPageExpirationTime

If the calculated page cache lifetime if very low (e.g. 60 seconds), it may not be possible to fill out a
form before the expiration time for the CR response is reached. This setting defines the minimum amount of
second, the calculated page cache lifetime must have. Default value is `900` seconds.

### additionalPageExpirationTime

Defines the amount of seconds, which is added to the calculated page cache lifetime, if the calculated page cache
lifetime is below the defined value in `minimumPageExpirationTime`.

### obfuscationMethod

Defines the obfuscation method used for the challenge/response calculation. Possible values are:

* `1` - ROT13 (default value)
* `2` - Reverse String

## Logging

To log failed requests, it is possible to use a dedicated logfile like shown below:

```
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['LOG']['Derhansen']['FormCrshield']['writerConfiguration'] = [
    \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Log\LogLevel::DEBUG => [
        \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Log\Writer\FileWriter::class => [
            'logFile' => \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Core\Environment::getVarPath() . '/log/form-crshield.log',
        ]
    ]
];
```

## Usage in own extensions

The extension provides the service `ChallengeResponseService` which can be used to retrieve and validate
the challenge and the expected response. 3rd party extensions can use this service and the included JavaScript
snippet to implement the challenge/response protection in their own forms (e.g. Extbase forms).
